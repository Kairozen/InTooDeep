A 2D platformer game made with C++ and the SFML library.

## Controls

Z / Q / S / D : Direction keys
Spacebar : Jump
LeftShift : Dash

You can dash mid-air in all 8 directions using the direction keys and the dash button. You can usually do only one dash before landing on the ground again, but when picking up a ruby, you will be able to dash again mid-air. 

If the character is next to a wall and you press the direction key towards the wall, you will be able to wall slide, reducing your falling speed. 

You can perform a wall jump while wall sliding by pressing the jump button.
